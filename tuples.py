# A tuple is a type of data structure where you can store different values
# Why a tuple instead of a list?
# In practicle usecases people will use tuples for data dat is never going to change!

# A tuple is unique because it's inmuttable
# Once created you can not modify it (one of the key differences with a list)
coordinates = (4, 5)
print(coordinates)

# accessing elements inside of a tuple
print(coordinates[0])

#list of tuples
coordinates2 = [(4, 5), (6,7), (80,34)]
print(coordinates2)
